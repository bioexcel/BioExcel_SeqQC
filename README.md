# SeqQC
Python scripts for submitting Sequence Quality Control pipeline to PBS-based machines (e.g. Cirrus)

Requirements:
- FastQC

Above packages can be easily obtained via installing BCBio, which also includes packages used in further downstream analysis.
- Make sure paths are correctly set up if done so.
